# Singapore Natural Gas Refueling Infrastructure Market: Market Trends, Analytical Insights, and Forecasting until 2033 | Cryostar SAS, Apache Corporation, Blu LNG, Trillium CNG

<strong>Natural Gas Refueling Infrastructure Market Snapshot 2025-2033:</strong>

With an increase in the number of natural gas vehicles, significant growth in natural gas refueling infrastructure has been witnessed across the globe. Natural gas is primarily used in two forms, namely compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Natural gas when compressed over 200 bars gets converted into CNG and is stored in high-pressure storage tanks. Natural gas when cooled to -161°C gets converted in liquid form and is stored in highly-insulated tanks. Generally, CNG occupies more volume of gas at standard conditions while LNG occupies small volume of gas.
